# End-to-End-Loan-Approval-Classifier-with-Explainable-AI

## Project Overview
This project involves building an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict loan approval status using advanced classification models. The pipeline covers the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment for real-world applications.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive **data preprocessing** including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
- Implementation of multiple **classification algorithms** such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** for comparative performance analysis.
- Model evaluation using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Final model deployment for making predictions on new data inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and implementation.
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, and **Pandas** for building machine learning models and data handling.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development and visualization.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a reliable loan approval prediction system that assists financial institutions in making data-driven decisions and improving loan approval processes.
